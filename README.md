### Data Warehouse project: ETL pipeline and AWS Redshift


A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

**Summary**: Building an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. Finally, we'll be able to test our database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results. 

In this project, I'll demonstrate how to make an ETL pipeline and prepare JSON files to star schema database, that Sparkify's analytics can use for their analysis. 

The data warehouse is built with AWS Redshift using Infrastructure-as-code (IaC). You can chekc the code for setting AWS Redshift up from Jupyter notebook, link: [AWS_IaC_Redshift.ipynb](https://github.com/vjaakola/data-warehouse-aws-redshift/blob/master/AWS_IaC_Redshift.ipynb)


This project is part of Udacity's Data Engineer Nanodegree program.

## Database Schema

First, we have to make staging tables for the copy of S3 bucket and then create and insert finale tables. I used to Zstandard (ZSTD) encoding because it provides a high compression ratio across diverse datasets.

Data model is a star schema: **songplays** is a fact table and dimension tables are **songs** , **artists**, **users** and **time**.

## Datasets
The **song dataset** is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. Below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}


The **log dataset** dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.


## Example

Here is a testing query for Sparkify's analytics, that we can see, how it works.
